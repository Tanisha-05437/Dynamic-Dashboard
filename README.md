Through this dashboard, we have examined total sales volume, the quantity of products sold, category-wise performance (such as footwear vs. apparel), and the popularity of different product lines. Special attention has been given to understanding how Adidas products perform across various regions, including the West, Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and South.

Additionally, the study delves into sales trends across different retail channels, comparing in-store, online, and outlet performance.
